Documentation: NFA to DFA Conversion

This documentation explains the functionality of the provided code, which converts a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The code consists of several functions and a main program to demonstrate the conversion process.


Class NFA:

This class represents the NFA and stores its states, alphabet, transitions, start state, and accept states.


Function epsilon_closure(nfa, states):

This function calculates the epsilon closure of a set of states in the given NFA.



Parameters:



nfa: An instance of the NFA class.

states: A set of states for which the epsilon closure needs to be calculated.

Returns:


frozenset(closure): A frozenset containing the epsilon closure of the input states.

Function move(nfa, states, symbol):

This function computes the set of states that can be reached from a given set of states by transitioning on a particular symbol.



Parameters:



nfa: An instance of the NFA class.

states: A set of states from which the transition needs to be made.

symbol: The symbol on which the transition is made.

Returns:



frozenset(moves): A frozenset containing the states reached by the transition.

Function nfa_to_dfa(nfa):

This function performs the conversion of the NFA to a DFA using the powerset construction algorithm.



Parameters:



nfa: An instance of the NFA class representing the NFA.

Returns:



NFA(dfa_states, nfa.alphabet, dfa_transitions, dfa_start_state, dfa_accept_states): An instance of the NFA class representing the converted DFA.

Function change_format_of_DFA(dfa):

This function changes the format of the DFA object by converting its states and accept states to sets.



Parameters:



dfa: An instance of the NFA class representing the DFA.

Returns:



dfa: The modified DFA object with states and accept states in the set format.

Function accept_string(dfa, input_string):

This function checks whether a given input string is accepted by the DFA or not.



Parameters:



dfa: An instance of the NFA class representing the DFA.

input_string: The input string to be checked for acceptance.

Returns:



True if the input string is accepted by the DFA, False otherwise.

Function get_nfa():

This function prompts the user to input the specifications of the NFA and constructs an instance of the NFA class accordingly.



Returns:



nfa: An instance of the NFA class representing the constructed NFA.

Main program:

The main program demonstrates the conversion process from NFA to DFA. It prompts the user to input the number of strings to test and the strings themselves. It constructs the NFA using the get_nfa() function and converts it to a DFA using nfa_to_dfa(nfa). It then changes the format of the DFA using change_format_of_DFA(dfa0). Finally, it checks the acceptance of each input string using accept_string(dfa, input_string) and prints the results.



Sample Inputs/Outputs:

The code includes sample inputs and outputs as comments at the end. These demonstrate the expected behavior of the program.



Note: The provided code assumes correct inputs and does not include extensive error handling. It is crucial to input the NFA specifications and strings in the expected format for accurate execution and valid results.
